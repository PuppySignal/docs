# Project structure

The project is divided in a few repositories, such as the backend, the mobile application, and the web-app.

- [Backend](https://github.com/PuppySignal/backend): The backend is the one in charge of handling the logic, authentication, tracking, image procesing, etc.
- [Mobile](https://github.com/PuppySignal/mobile_v2): As the name suggest, is where the mobile application is stored, here is where we manage our accounts, create pets, receive notifications, etc.
- [Frontend](https://github.com/PuppySignal/frontend): Is the website where the person who scans the code is taken and receives the information about the pet who had just scanned.
