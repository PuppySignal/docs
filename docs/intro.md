# Puppysignal

The idea behind Puppysignal is to have a way to keep track of our pets through the use of QR Codes. 

Whenever we create a profile for our pets on our accounts, a small code will be generated and associated to them, and a QRCode will be available for printing. When someone scan this code, the person will have the contact information we provide to get in contact with us, and at the same time, we will receive a push notification with the location of where our pet was scanned.
